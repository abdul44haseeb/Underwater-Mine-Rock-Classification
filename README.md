# Underwater-Mine-Rock-Classification
Welcome to the "Underwater Mine-Rock Classification" repository! This project uses logistic regression to predict whether an underwater object is a "mine" or a "rock" based on sonar readings. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and contribute to marine safety and exploration. Dive in and explore the code and results! ðŸŒŠðŸš€
